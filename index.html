    <h1>Sample project</h1>
    <p>
      Devslopes was created to offer a human alternative to apathetic coding
      bootcamps and archaic universities. We identified the number one reason
      why aspiring software engineers can’t land a job: They don’t have any
      professional experience. Our mentors teach you how to land paid projects
      that you can use to build an incredible resume of real experience. But
      that's not all! Hackathons are a major part of our community: Our students
      pair up in teams to compete against one another to build real world
      projects that we pay them for. And this year alone, we've paid out over
      $25,000 to our Hackathon winners!
